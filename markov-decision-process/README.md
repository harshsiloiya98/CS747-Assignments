# Assignment-2: Markov Decision Problem
This assignment uses two types of algorithms for finding the optimum value and policy for a given Markov Decision Problem, namely:
* Linear Programming
* Policy Iteration

For solving linear programming problems, the Python library [PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/) is used.
