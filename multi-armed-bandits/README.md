# Assignment-1: Multi Armed Bandits
This assignment features the implementation of various algorithms for solving the multi-armed bandit problem, namely:
* Round-robin method
* Îµ-greedy algorithm
* Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
* Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound (KL-UCB) algorithm
* Thompson Sampling

A Bernoulli bandit arm is used for solving the bandit problem.
